Hello Jane Doe,

I recently came across the new website that XYZ Company built for City Services. I was so impressed by its design and functionality. My background in front-end development and user interfaces would make me a great fit for the UX Designer position at XYZ Company.

I am a passionate Designer with experience in wireframing, UI patterns, and user flows. For the past year, I have worked as a UX Designer at Design Company. I helped develop tools such as a customizable management system and a new web portal.

I was a key member of the team that developed an app to connect consumers, which was awarded Best Design at the 2020 Design Awards.

My experience turning broad problems into simple, user-friendly solutions would make me an excellent candidate for XYZ Company. Now that XYZ Company is entering the consumer space, I can bring a lot of practical insight to the team. I believe that XYZ Company’s dedication to innovation and emphasis on teamwork is the perfect environment for me to flourish as a designer.

I would love to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills can contribute to XYZ Company’s future. I have included my resume, and my portfolio is available at myuxdesignerwebsite.com. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
