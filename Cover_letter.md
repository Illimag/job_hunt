Consider some of these questions as you write a cover letter:

What makes you a great UX Designer?

What are your relevant UX experiences?

Why do you want to work there?

What unique qualities will you bring to help their company?

To create an outline for a UX Designer cover letter, you can follow this general structure:

Heading, including your name and contact information
Date

The Hiring Manager’s name and title, and the company’s name and address

Greeting

Introductory paragraph

Body paragraph(s)

Closing paragraph

Sign off

What to In

Heading: The heading of your letter should include basic information, such as your name, email address, and phone number. You should also include links to your digital profiles, such as a website or online portfolio and LinkedIn page.

Greeting: Your cover letter should include a personal salutation when possible. Look at the job posting or research the company to find out the name and title of the company’s Hiring Manager. This will make a stronger impact compared to generic greetings.

Introduction: The first sentence of your cover letter should grab the reader’s interest and make them want to know more about you. You can express your passions, mention a contact, or state an accomplishment.

Relevant skills and experience: Review the job description and identify the most important hard and soft skills for the position. Focus on highlighting these skills in your cover letter.

UX design experience: Explain the role and impact you have had as a UX Designer. Frame your design experiences as it relates to the company. For example, share a UX design project you worked on and explain how your UX skills are relevant to the company’s needs.

Reasons for applying: Your cover letter should also share what interests you about the job and why you want to join their team. Employers are looking for enthusiastic candidates, so showing your passion will help you stand out.

Closing: End your cover letter graciously and reiterate your interest and skills. Thank the Hiring Manager for their time and invite them to further engage with you.
