Dear sir or madam,

I have been a fan of XYZ Company for years, so I was thrilled to see an opening on the team for a UX Designer. I am particularly inspired by your recent work creating the XYZ app. I think my experience in design systems, user research, and app design would make me a great addition to your team.

For the past two years, I have worked as a UI/UX Designer, creating seamless web and mobile applications for various clients. At Design Company, I was responsible for the development and implementation of several new user-facing products. I worked cross-functionally with product and development teams to integrate a new customer support portal, leading to a 65% increase in customer satisfaction. I am eager to apply my expertise to help build the next version of the XYZ app.

I admire XYZ Company’s commitment to empowering communities. Your dedication to building products that help communities thrive strongly aligns with my values as a Designer. As someone who volunteers regularly in my community, I believe I would be a great fit for XYZ Company.

I am excited to help enhance XYZ Company’s already great work. I have attached my resume and portfolio. Please feel free to contact me at 555-555-5555 or me@myuxdesignerwebsite.com. Thank you kindly for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you,
